Version 0.1-5
===================

BUG FIXES:

-   Improvements to algorithm: ignores everything after 'keep',
    ignores 'at least', handles 'x-weekly' and 'x-monthly' (where
    x is a number) correctly, handles addition (e.g. 20mg + 40mg daily)
-   Suppresses console output if noisy=FALSE
-   Corrected error in combining regimens if first dose is 'stat'
    and second dose is being used, or when combining 'or' where
    dose 1 has quantity but no time (e.g. 1 or 2 twice a day)

Version 0.1-4
===================

BUG FIXES:

-   Corrected error in combining regimens if one has missing time
-   Keep initial regimen if second regimen is a maximum dose and is
    greater than the first regimen (as intended)

Version 0.1-3
===================

BUG FIXES:

-   Carry on if there is an error for one of the texts in doseconvert

Version 0.1-2
===================

CHANGES:

-   textid now defaults to numbers rather than text strings
-   Lookup table specification in doseconvert altered; now there is an
    option to supply only a single lookup table (customlookups) or use
    the built-in lookup table (option usebuiltinlookups = TRUE)
-   Some corrections to lookup tables
-   New option maxifchoice, whether to return maximum or average
    dose if there is a choice of dose. Returns maximum dose by default
-   Modified testdoseconvert function - now uses the same arguments
    as doseconvert, and can compare the results with a gold standard
-   Added 'combined' as a return option for multiple doses combined
    into a single dose
-   Corrected the function for combining multiple dose lines

Version 0.1-1
===================

CHANGES:

-   Some corrections to lookup tables
-   Additional information in documentation
